    **To the One Who Lights My World**

    Todayâ€™s your day, my love, my light,  
    A star that makes my dark skies bright.  
    With every smile, with every touch,  
    You show me love, and oh, how much.

    Your laughter is my favorite song,  
    With you, my heart feels right, feels strong.  
    Each moment shared, both big and small,  
    You're the most precious gift of all.

    You bloom with grace, a rare delight,  
    More radiant than the moon at night.  
    No words can truly quite convey  
    The joy you bring me every day.

    So on your birthday, hereâ€™s my vow:  
    To cherish you then, now, and howâ€”  
    Forevermore, Iâ€™ll hold you dear,  
    With love that grows each passing year.
